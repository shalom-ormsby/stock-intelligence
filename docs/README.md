# Documentation Organization

This folder contains supplementary documentation organized by purpose.

## Folder Structure

### `/archive/`
**Phase completion markers and implementation logs**

Historical documents tracking development phases and feature completions. These files document the development journey but are not essential for current operations.

- Error handling implementations (Phase 2-4)
- Retry logic completion
- v1.0 build progress and phase completions
- Webhook updates and user settings phases

### `/guides/`
**Implementation guides and reference documentation**

How-to guides and technical references for specific features and integrations.

- Notion database templates and write functions
- Rate limiting setup instructions
- Polling workflow documentation
- Testing checklists and quickstart guides

### `/legacy/`
**Superseded version documentation (v0.3.0 and earlier)**

Documentation from previous versions of the project. Kept for historical reference but no longer applicable to current v1.0+ architecture.

- v0.3.0 hotfixes, quick references, and upgrade summaries
- v1.0 roadmap updates (superseded by main ROADMAP.md)
- Legacy README files
