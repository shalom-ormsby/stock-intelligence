# v1.0 Build Progress

**Target:** Vercel Serverless + TypeScript + Notion-Native Architecture
**Goal:** Beta launch with 10-20 users
**Started:** October 29, 2025

---

## ✅ Completed (Week 1 - Foundation)

### 1. **API Research & Selection**
- ✅ Researched Financial Modeling Prep vs IEX Cloud
- ✅ **Decision:** FMP at $22/mo (IEX Cloud shut down in 2024)
- ✅ Final stack: FMP + FRED = $22/mo total (within $15-25 budget)

### 2. **Project Infrastructure**
- ✅ Created Vercel project structure
- ✅ Set up TypeScript configuration ([tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json))
- ✅ Created [package.json](package.json) with dependencies
- ✅ Created [vercel.json](vercel.json) for deployment config
- ✅ Created [.env.v1.example](.env.v1.example) for v1.0 setup

**Dependencies Added:**
- `@notionhq/client` - Notion API integration
- `@vercel/edge-config` - Rate limiting
- `@vercel/kv` - User quotas
- `axios` - HTTP client
- `zod` - Data validation

### 3. **API Clients**
- ✅ Built [FMP Client](lib/fmp-client.ts) - Full TypeScript client for Financial Modeling Prep
  - Real-time quotes
  - Historical prices
  - Technical indicators (RSI, SMA, EMA, MACD)
  - Fundamentals (income statements, balance sheets, ratios)
  - Optimized `getAnalysisData()` batch method
- ✅ Built [FRED Client](lib/fred-client.ts) - Macroeconomic data from Federal Reserve
  - Fed Funds Rate, Unemployment, Inflation
  - Treasury yields, VIX, Consumer Sentiment
  - Yield curve spread calculation
  - Optimized `getMacroData()` batch method

### 4. **Scoring Engine**
- ✅ Ported [ScoringConfig](config/scoring-config.ts) from Python v0.3.0
  - All thresholds documented with financial rationale
  - Market cap, P/E, RSI, MACD, volatility, beta ranges
- ✅ Ported [StockScorer](lib/scoring.ts) from Python v0.3.0
  - Technical scoring (30% weight)
  - Fundamental scoring (35% weight)
  - Macro scoring (20% weight)
  - Risk scoring (15% weight)
  - Sentiment scoring (standalone)
  - Composite score calculation
  - Buy/sell recommendations

- [ ] API key validation
- [ ] Webhook signature verification

### Week 5: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Single-user POC
- [ ] End-to-end testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Beta user setup guide
- [ ] Notion template creation

### Week 6: Beta Launch

## 📊 Architecture

```
User enters ticker in Notion
          ↓
Notion webhook → Vercel function
          ↓
Fetch data: FMP (technical + fundamental) + FRED (macro)
          ↓
Calculate scores (technical, fundamental, macro, risk, sentiment)
          ↓
Write results to Notion Stock Analyses
          ↓
Poll for AI analysis completion
          ↓
Archive to Stock History on user trigger
```

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

**Beta Launch Criteria:**
- [ ] Beta user can set up in < 10 minutes
- [ ] Analysis completes in < 30 seconds
- [ ] 99% uptime during beta
- [ ] All v0.3.0 features working (scoring, patterns, comparison)
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Clear error messages

**API Usage per Analysis:**
- FMP: ~11 calls (quote, profile, historical, technicals, fundamentals)
- FRED: ~6 calls (macro indicators)
- Notion: ~5-10 calls (read, write, poll, archive)
- **Total: ~22-27 API calls per analysis**

**Cost Estimate (10-20 users, 10 analyses/day each):**
- FMP: $22/mo (300 calls/min = plenty)
- FRED: Free (120 calls/day limit - need to monitor)
- Vercel: Free tier (100GB bandwidth, 100k serverless invocations)
- **Total: $22/mo for 100-200 analyses/day**

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

**v0.x (Python/Colab) → v1.0 (TypeScript/Vercel)**

- v0.x will remain functional until v1.0 is stable
- No breaking changes to v0.x during v1.0 development
- Beta users will test v1.0 alongside v0.x
- Full migration after v1.0 proven stable with 10-20 users

---

## 📝 Notes

- **API Selection:** FMP chosen over IEX Cloud (shut down) and Finnhub ($50/mo, over budget)
- **Rate Limits:** FMP Starter plan = 300 calls/min (plenty for 10-20 users)
- **FRED Limitation:** 120 calls/day = ~20 analyses/day max (need to monitor)
- **Vercel Free Tier:** Generous limits, should handle beta without cost
- **TypeScript:** Full type safety for better developer experience

**Last Updated:** October 29, 2025
**Current Phase:** Week 1 - Foundation (50% complete)
**Next Milestone:** Complete Notion client + analysis endpoint
