## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.9] - 2025-10-28

### Changed
- **Pattern Signal Score Distribution**: Improved `compute_pattern_score()` to fix clustering around 3.0
  - Replaced linear score accumulation with weighted signal accumulation system
  - Implemented non-linear scaling using hyperbolic tangent (tanh) for better score distribution
  - Separate bullish and bearish weight tracking for clearer signal separation
  - Refined pattern weights to reflect true technical significance:
    - Golden/Death Cross: 2.5 (very strong signals)
    - Trend structure: 1.8 (strong signals)
    - Volume surges: 1.5 (moderate-strong signals)
    - MACD crossovers: 1.3 (moderate-strong signals)
    - RSI extremes: 1.0 (moderate signals)
  - S-curve distribution now spreads scores across full 1.0-5.0 range
  - More sensitive scoring in middle range, stable at extremes
  - Better differentiation between neutral, bullish, and bearish patterns

### Technical Details
- Net signal calculation: `bullish_weight - bearish_weight` (typically -5.0 to +5.0)
- Tanh scaling: `tanh(net_signal * 0.5)` produces smooth -1.0 to +1.0 curve
- Final score: `3.0 + (scaled_signal Ã— 2.0)` for full range utilization
- Enhanced documentation with inline comments explaining the mathematical approach

## [0.2.8] - 2025-10-24

### Added
- **Content Status & Notification System**: Automated Notion notifications for fresh data
  - `Content Status` property added to all Notion syncs (Stock Analyses, Stock History, Market Context)
  - Status values: "New" for fresh records, "Updated" for existing page updates
  - Enables Notion database automations to trigger notifications when new analysis arrives
  - Useful for setting up Slack/email alerts when stocks are analyzed

### Changed
- All Notion sync operations now include Content Status field for better automation support

## [0.2.7] - 2025-10-24

  - `SectorAnalyzer` ranks 11 sector ETFs and interprets rotation patterns
  - `NotionMarketSync` syncs market analysis to Notion Market Context database
  - `analyze_market()` convenience function for standalone market analysis
  - US indices: SPY, QQQ, DIA, IWM, VIX with 1-day, 5-day, 1-month, 3-month performance

# Full market analysis with Notion sync
analyze_market()

# Programmatic use without printing or syncing
results = analyze_market(print_results=False, sync_to_notion=False)
```

### API Calls Per Analysis
- Polygon: ~16 calls (5 indices + 11 sector ETFs)
- FRED: 4 calls (economic indicators)
- Brave Search: 3 calls (optional, if API key configured)
- Total: ~23 calls (well within rate limits)

## [0.2.6] - 2025-10-24

### Added
- **Notion Comparison Sync**: Automatically save multi-stock comparisons to Notion for historical tracking

  3. Return results programmatically (always)

### Configuration
- Made STOCK_COMPARISONS_DB_ID optional - shows warning instead of error if not set
- Updated `.env.example` with new database ID template

### Usage
```python
# Full experience - print + sync to Notion
compare_stocks(['NVDA', 'MSFT', 'AMZN'])

# Programmatic only - no console output, no Notion sync

compare_stocks(['IONQ', 'QBTS', 'QUBT'])

# Get results programmatically
results = compare_stocks(['AAPL', 'GOOGL'], print_results=False)
buy_recommendation = results['recommendation']['buy_now']
