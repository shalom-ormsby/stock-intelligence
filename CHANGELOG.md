## [Unreleased]

## [2.5.3] - 2025-10-23

### Added
- **Centralized Scoring Configuration**: Introduced `ScoringConfig` class with documented rationale for all thresholds
  - All magic numbers now have clear financial/technical justifications
  - Market cap thresholds based on SEC definitions and industry standards
  - P/E ratio ranges based on historical S&P 500 averages (~15-20 long-term)

  - Easy to tune scoring strategy by adjusting config values

### Changed

- **100% backward compatible**: All scores produce identical results

### Documentation
- Added inline documentation for every threshold with financial context

- **Added Business Source License 1.1**: Allows personal/educational use, restricts commercial competition
  - Automatically converts to MIT License on October 23, 2029
  - Protects commercial interests while remaining community-friendly
- Updated README with clear licensing terms and usage guidelines
- Renamed main file from `stock_intelligence_v2.5.2_secure.py` to `stock_intelligence.py` (version tracked internally)

  - Removed completed implementation details
  - Updated success metrics to reflect progress
  - Phase 1.2 (Pattern Validation) and 1.3 (Comparative Analysis) remain pending

### Changed
- **Roadmap Reorganization**: Updated ROADMAP.md to prioritize decision-making clarity over infrastructure
  - New Phase 1 focuses on: Scoring Config, Pattern Validation, and Comparative Analysis
  - Deferred logging, caching, and rate limiting (solve non-problems for 1-3 stocks/day workflow)
  - Aligned priorities with actual use case: personal decision-support tool for daily earnings plays

### Documentation
- Added design philosophy to roadmap: "Impeccable but simple. Personal decision-support tool for daily stock analyses ahead of earnings. Not enterprise software."

## [2.5.2] - 2025-10-22

### Added
