# User Settings Phase 1: Notion-Native Setup (v1.0.1a)

**Implementation Time:** 30 minutes
**Approach:** Notion database + automation (no frontend code)
**Validation:** 3-5 beta users before deciding on Phase 2

---

## Why Start with Notion?

✅ **Zero frontend code needed** - Your backend APIs already work
✅ **Fastest to market** - 30 min vs 1-4 hours for web UI
✅ **Native to your workflow** - You're already in Notion
✅ **Reversible decision** - Can add web UI later if needed
✅ **Validate with real users** - Learn what they actually need

---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create User Settings Database (5 minutes)

1. **Open your Notion workspace** where Stock Intelligence lives
2. **Create new database**:
   - Click "+ New" → "Database - Inline"
   - Name it: **"User Settings"**
   - Location: Top-level page or inside Stock Intelligence folder

3. **Add Properties** (click "+ Add a property" for each):

| Property Name | Type | Configuration | Notes |
|---------------|------|---------------|-------|
| **User** | Person | Single person select | Primary - who this setting belongs to |
| **User ID** | Text | Plain text | Notion user ID (auto-filled or manual) |
| **Bypass Code** | Text | Plain text | User enters code here to activate |
| **Bypass Active** | Checkbox | Default: unchecked | Read-only, shows if bypass is active |
| **Expires At** | Date | Include time | Shows when bypass expires (midnight UTC) |
| **Usage Today** | Number | Format: Number | Optional - shows analyses used today |
| **Daily Limit** | Number | Format: Number | Default: 10 |
| **Last Updated** | Last edited time | Auto | Tracks when settings changed |
| **Status** | Status | Options: Active, Inactive, Error | Visual indicator of bypass status |

4. **Set Default View**:
   - View: Table
   - Sort: User (A → Z)
   - Filter: (none initially)

### Step 2: Create Your Personal Settings Entry (2 minutes)

1. **Add New Row**:
   - Click "+ New" in the database
   - Set **User**: Select yourself
   - Set **User ID**: Your Notion user ID (find it in your Notion profile URL)
   - Set **Daily Limit**: 10
   - Leave **Bypass Code** empty for now
   - Set **Status**: Inactive

2. **Find Your Notion User ID**:
   - Go to Settings & Members → My Account
   - Copy ID from URL or profile data
   - Example format: `abc123-def456-ghi789`

### Step 3: Set Up Notion Automation (10 minutes)

**Option A: Built-in Notion Automation (Recommended)**

1. **Click "..." menu** in top-right of User Settings database
2. **Select "Automations" → "New automation"**
3. **Configure trigger**:
   - Trigger: "When property edited"
   - Property: "Bypass Code"
   - Filter: "Bypass Code is not empty"

4. **Configure action**:
   - Action: "Send request to API"
   - Method: POST
   - URL: `https://stock-intelligence.vercel.app/api/bypass`
   - Headers:
     ```json
     {
       "Content-Type": "application/json"
     }
     ```
   - Body:
     ```json
     {
       "userId": "{{page.User ID}}",
       "code": "{{page.Bypass Code}}"
     }
     ```

5. **Add follow-up action** (optional - show success):
   - Action: "Update property"
   - Property: "Status"
   - Value: "Active" (if API returns success)

6. **Save automation**

**Option B: Make.com / Zapier Integration (If Notion automation doesn't support API calls)**

If Notion's built-in automation doesn't support API calls, use Make.com:

1. **Create Make.com account** (free tier)
2. **Create new scenario**:
   - Trigger: "Notion - Watch Database Items"
   - Database: User Settings
   - Trigger field: "Bypass Code"
3. **Add HTTP module**:
   - Method: POST
   - URL: `https://stock-intelligence.vercel.app/api/bypass`
   - Body:
     ```json
     {
       "userId": "{{User ID}}",
       "code": "{{Bypass Code}}"
     }
     ```
4. **Add Notion module** (update status):
   - Action: "Update Database Item"
   - Database: User Settings
   - Page ID: {{trigger page ID}}
   - Properties:
     - "Bypass Active": true (if HTTP response success)
     - "Status": "Active"
     - "Expires At": {{HTTP response expiresAt}}
5. **Save and activate scenario**

### Step 4: Test the Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Get your bypass code**:
   - Go to Vercel → Project Settings → Environment Variables
   - Find `RATE_LIMIT_BYPASS_CODE`
   - Copy the value

2. **Test in Notion**:
   - Open your User Settings row
   - Paste bypass code into "Bypass Code" property
   - Wait 5-10 seconds for automation to run
   - Check if "Status" changes to "Active"

3. **Verify in backend**:
   ```bash
   # Check usage endpoint
   curl https://stock-intelligence.vercel.app/api/usage \
     -H "X-User-ID: your-notion-user-id"
   ```

   Expected response:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "usage": {
       "bypassed": true,
       "remaining": 999
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Test analysis**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://stock-intelligence.vercel.app/api/analyze \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"ticker": "AAPL", "userId": "your-notion-user-id"}'
   ```

   Should complete without rate limit (even if you've used 10+ analyses today)

## User Workflow (Once Set Up)

### For End Users:

1. **User opens "User Settings" database in Notion**
2. **User finds their row** (filtered by their name)
3. **User checks current status**:
   - "Bypass Active" ✅ = Unlimited access until midnight
   - "Bypass Active" ❌ = Normal limits (10/day)
   - "Usage Today" = How many analyses used today
4. **User enters bypass code** (when needed):
   - Edit "Bypass Code" property
   - Paste the code
   - Wait 5-10 seconds
   - Status updates automatically
5. **User runs analyses** via Notion automation or API

### Manual Usage Check:

Users can also check usage via curl:
```bash
curl https://stock-intelligence.vercel.app/api/usage \
  -H "X-User-ID: their-notion-user-id"
```

## Beta Testing Guide (Phase 1 Validation)

### Target: 3-5 Power Users

**Ideal Beta Testers:**
- Already use Notion daily
- Comfortable with databases and properties
- Will give honest feedback
- Represent your target user base

### Testing Checklist:

**Week 1: Basic Functionality**
- [ ] Can users find the User Settings database?
- [ ] Can users enter bypass code successfully?
- [ ] Does automation trigger correctly?
- [ ] Does status update within 10 seconds?
- [ ] Can users see their daily usage?

**Week 2: Usage Patterns**
- [ ] How often do users check their settings?
- [ ] Do they understand the bypass code concept?
- [ ] What questions/confusion arise?
- [ ] Do they request additional features?

**Week 3: Feedback Collection**
Ask users:
1. "Is the Notion database UI acceptable for managing settings?"
2. "Would you prefer a web page instead? Why or why not?"
3. "What features are missing that you need?"
4. "On a scale of 1-10, how satisfied are you with this approach?"

---

## Decision Criteria for Phase 2

**Build HTML Settings Page (Phase 2) if:**
- ≥3 of 5 users request web UI
- Users report significant friction with Notion database
- Non-Notion users want to access settings
- Users request features Notion can't provide (charts, real-time updates)
- Satisfaction score < 7/10

**Stay with Notion (don't build Phase 2) if:**
- Users are satisfied with Notion database (≥8/10)
- No requests for web UI after 2 weeks
- Friction is minimal
- All users already use Notion daily
- No feature requests that require web UI

**Skip to Phase 3 (Next.js) if:**
- User base grows beyond Notion power users
- Need to onboard non-Notion users
- Require advanced features (analytics, mobile app, etc.)
- Revenue justifies $4k+ investment in professional UI

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Automation Doesn't Trigger

**Possible causes:**
- Notion automation not enabled
- Wrong property selected as trigger
- API endpoint URL incorrect

**Fix:**
1. Check automation is active (green toggle)
2. Verify trigger property is "Bypass Code"
3. Test API manually with curl
4. Check Vercel logs for incoming requests

### Issue: Status Doesn't Update

**Possible causes:**
- API call failed
- Response not parsed correctly
- Automation doesn't have update action

**Fix:**
1. Check Make.com/Zapier logs for errors
2. Test API response format
3. Add error handling to automation
4. Manually update status as workaround

### Issue: Bypass Code Invalid

**Possible causes:**
- Wrong code entered
- Extra spaces in code
- Environment variable not set correctly

**Fix:**
1. Verify code in Vercel env vars
2. Copy-paste code (don't type manually)
3. Check for trailing spaces
4. Test with curl first
