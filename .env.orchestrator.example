# Stock Analysis Orchestrator Configuration (v1.0.5)
#
# Add these variables to your .env file to configure the orchestrator

# === Rate Limiting ===

# Delay between ticker analyses (in milliseconds)
# Prevents API overload by spacing out requests
# Default: 8000 (8 seconds)
# Adjust based on your LLM provider's rate limits:
#   - Gemini Free: 8000-10000ms (2 RPM limit)
#   - Gemini Paid: 3000-5000ms (higher limits)
#   - Claude/OpenAI: 5000-7000ms (varies by tier)
ANALYSIS_DELAY_MS=8000

# === Dry Run Mode ===

# Enable dry-run mode for testing without making actual API calls
# When enabled, orchestrator will:
#   - Collect and deduplicate stock requests
#   - Build and display priority queue
#   - Simulate analysis and broadcasting
#   - Log what WOULD happen without actual execution
#   - Calculate API calls that would be saved
# Default: false
# Set to 'true' for testing
ORCHESTRATOR_DRY_RUN=false
