### v1.0: Serverless Migration (70% Complete)

*Production-ready serverless architecture on Vercel*

**Completed Work:**

**API Migration:**

- ✅ Researched and selected consolidated provider (FMP + FRED)
- ✅ Set up Vercel TypeScript development environment
- ✅ Ported scoring logic from v0.3 Python to TypeScript (~2,500 LOC)
- ✅ Created /api/analyze endpoint (390 LOC)
- ✅ Created /api/webhook endpoint for archiving (180 LOC)
- ✅ Configured environment variables and secrets

**Refactoring:**

- ✅ Extracted API fetching logic into modular functions
- ✅ Extracted score calculation into pure functions
- ✅ Extracted Notion read/write operations
- ✅ Extracted AI prompt execution logic

**Deployment:**

- ✅ Deployed to Vercel production
- ✅ Made API endpoints publicly accessible (CORS enabled)
- ✅ Configured Notion automation for "Send to History"
- ✅ Test scripts for local development (240 LOC)
- ✅ Documentation (SETUP.md, testing guides - 750 LOC)

**Testing:**

- ✅ End-to-end workflow tested (ticker input → analysis → archive)
- ✅ Security audit completed
- ✅ Production validation with MSFT test case

**Cumulative Stats:**

- ~4,000 lines TypeScript code
- ~2,500 lines documentation
- 17 total files
- Performance: 3-5 seconds per analysis
- Cost: $22-29/month (FMP + Vercel)

## 📊 Current Architecture

**Technology Stack:**

- **Platform:** Vercel serverless functions (TypeScript/Node.js)
- **Financial Data:** Financial Modeling Prep API ($22-29/mo)
- **Macro Data:** FRED API (free)
- **Integration:** Notion API

**Data Flow:**

1. User sets "Request Analysis" = true in Stock Analyses database
2. Notion automation → POST to `/api/webhook` with ticker + page data
3. Vercel function:
   - Fetches technical + fundamental data from FMP
   - Fetches macro indicators from FRED
   - Calculates scores (Composite + Pattern)
   - Writes metrics back to Notion page
4. Notion AI generates 7-section analysis narrative
5. User clicks "Send to History" → archive to Stock History database

**Performance:**

- 3-5 seconds per analysis
- 17-21 total API calls
- 60-second function timeout

**Design Philosophy:** Impeccable but simple. Personal decision-support tool for daily stock analyses ahead of earnings. Not enterprise software.
