## Recent Completions

### ‚úÖ v1.0.0: Rate Limiting System (COMPLETED)

**Status:** Production deployed and tested
**Time invested:** ~4 hours
**Completion date:** October 31, 2025

**What shipped:**

1. **Distributed rate limiting with Upstash Redis**
   - User-level quotas: 10 analyses per user per day
   - Automatic midnight UTC reset
   - Graceful degradation (fails open if Redis unavailable)
   - REST API integration (serverless-compatible)

2. **Session-based bypass code system**
   - One-time code entry, session stored in Redis
   - Unlimited analyses until midnight UTC
   - Easily revokable via environment variable
   - Production endpoint: `/api/bypass`

3. **API endpoints delivered:**
   - `/api/bypass` - Activate bypass code sessions
   - `/api/usage` - Check current usage without consuming quota
   - `/api/analyze` - Enhanced with rate limiting integration

4. **Production validation:**
   - ‚úÖ Health check passed
   - ‚úÖ Usage endpoint working (shows remaining quota)
   - ‚úÖ Rate limit counter incrementing correctly
   - ‚úÖ Bypass code activation tested successfully
   - ‚ùå Analysis timeout issue discovered (infrastructure limitation, deferred to v1.0.3)

**Files created/modified:**
- `lib/rate-limiter.ts` (340 LOC) - Core rate limiting logic
- `lib/errors.ts` (modified) - Added RateLimitError class
- `api/bypass.ts` (115 LOC) - Bypass code endpoint
- `api/usage.ts` (115 LOC) - Usage tracking endpoint
- `api/analyze.ts` (modified) - Integrated rate limiting
- `.env.v1.example` (modified) - Added Upstash Redis configuration
- `RATE_LIMITING_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide

**Technical decisions:**
- Chose Upstash Redis over Vercel KV (better free tier, REST API)
- Session-based bypass approach (UX over stateless security)
- Rate limit headers in HTTP responses (standard compliance)
- TypeScript interfaces exported for external usage

### üîÑ v1.0.1: User Settings Page (PIVOTED)

**Status:** Architecture pivot in progress
**Original plan:** Phased validation approach (Notion ‚Üí HTML ‚Üí Next.js)
**Current blocker:** Notion webhook limitations discovered

**Phase 1 outcome (Notion-native approach):**

**What we built:**
- ‚úÖ `/api/bypass` modified to accept URL parameters (GET + POST)
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained (JSON body still works)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation (3 guides created)
- ‚úÖ Notion database template designed
- ‚ùå **BLOCKER:** Notion webhooks can't pass dynamic property values

**Notion limitations discovered:**
1. Webhooks can't send custom JSON body variables
2. URL parameters can't be dynamically generated from database properties
3. Formula-generated URLs aren't clickable in Notion
4. Checkboxes trigger webhooks but can't pass the checkbox value itself
5. No workaround exists within Notion's current API capabilities

**What we learned:**
- Notion-native approach requires manual copy-paste workflows (poor UX)
- Notion database still valuable for admin tracking
- API changes (URL parameter support) are production-ready
- **New direction needed:** Integrated Notion analysis workflow

**Time invested:** ~2 hours (documentation + API modification)
**Wasted effort:** None - API improvements are reusable, documentation clarified constraints

---

## Current Priority: Notion-Native Analysis Workflow

**User request:** "Prioritize the tasks required to allow me to run analyses entirely in Notion (without any external interactions)"

**Context:**
- User wants to eliminate external tool interactions
- Analyses should be triggered and viewed entirely within Notion
- Current workflow requires manual copy-paste for bypass codes
- Goal is seamless, Notion-native UX

**Questions to clarify before implementation:**
1. What does "run analyses" mean in this context?
   - Enter ticker symbol and get analysis results?
   - Batch analysis of multiple tickers?
   - Automated scheduled analysis?

2. What interactions are acceptable?
   - Clicking a button/checkbox to trigger analysis? (acceptable?)
   - Viewing results in the same Notion page? (acceptable?)
   - Opening a separate Notion page for results? (acceptable?)

3. Who is the primary user?
   - Admin/beta tester only?
   - End users accessing via shared Notion workspace?

4. What information needs to be input?
   - Just ticker symbol?
   - Additional parameters (date range, analysis type)?

5. What information should be displayed?
   - Full analysis results (7 sections)?
   - Summary metrics only?
   - Composite score and recommendation?

6. Integration with existing databases?
   - Should this write to Stock Analyses database?
   - Should this respect rate limiting?
   - Should this use bypass codes at all?

## Known Issues & Deferred Work

### v1.0.3: Infrastructure Upgrade (DEFERRED)

**Issue:** Vercel free tier timeout (10-second limit)
**Impact:** `/api/analyze` endpoint times out on production
**Workaround:** Rate limiting still works correctly (counter increments)
**Fix required:** Upgrade to Vercel Pro ($20/month) for 60-second timeout
**Timeline:** After completing v1.0.2 (Admin Dashboard)

**Backlog task created:** Notion task added with timing recommendation

---

## Architecture Learnings

**What worked well:**
- Upstash Redis integration (serverless-native, no connection pooling issues)
- Phased validation approach (test simplest solution first)
- Documentation-first workflow (guides before implementation)
- Dual input method support (backward compatibility)

**What didn't work:**
- Notion webhooks for dynamic user workflows (too limited)
- Notion formulas for generating interactive URLs (not clickable)
- Checkbox triggers for passing state (value not accessible)

**Patterns established:**
- Environment variable extraction: `extractUserId(req)`
- Error handling: Custom error classes with user-friendly messages
- Rate limiting: Session-based bypass with TTL expiry
- Testing: curl commands for production validation
- Deployment: GitHub Desktop push ‚Üí Vercel auto-deploy

## Updated Sprint Timeline

**Completed (Oct 31):**
- ‚úÖ v1.0.0: Rate Limiting System

**In Progress (Oct 31):**
- üîÑ v1.0.1: User Settings Page ‚Üí PIVOTED to Notion-native analysis workflow

**Upcoming:**
- ‚è≥ v1.0.2: Admin Dashboard (timing TBD based on v1.0.1 pivot)
- ‚è≥ v1.0.3: Infrastructure Upgrade (Vercel Pro, deferred)

**Open questions:**
- Should v1.0.1 pivot be renamed to reflect new scope?
- Should Notion-native analysis be a separate version (v1.0.1b or v1.0.4)?
- What is the minimum viable implementation for Notion-native workflow?

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate:** Clarify requirements for Notion-native analysis workflow
**Then:** Design integration approach within Notion's API constraints
**After:** Implement minimum viable solution and test with beta users
**Finally:** Validate with user feedback before building v1.0.2

---

**Key Insight:** Notion's webhook limitations force us to rethink integration strategy. Instead of building external tools that Notion calls, we need to build Notion-first workflows that leverage the API's strengths (database operations, page updates) rather than its weaknesses (webhook limitations).
